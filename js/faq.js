    "answer": 
        "Jeremy Corbyn is a <a href='http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/aug/26/bernie-sanders-socialist-or-democratic-socialist/'><i>democratic socialist</i></a>. He believes that our current economic system isn't doing enough for the poor and the middle-class in our society and that democratic change is needed to create a fairer and more just society.<br><br>" + 
        "But this isn't radical or scary. Many of the programs instituted by post war governments that we take for granted today &mdash; such as the NHS, the limited hours of work, the minimum wage, and Social Security &mdash; could be described as socialist programs."

   "answer": "Most people will be better off under Corbyn's tax plan. " +
		"These are the proposals: " + 
		"<ul><li>Reverse the cuts to Corporation Tax.</li>" +
		"<li>Reverse cuts to Inheritance Tax</li>" +		
		"<li>Introduce a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax\" target=\"_blank\">land value tax</a></li>" +
		"<li>Increase the top rate of tax to 50p from the current rate 45p.  This rate is only paid on income over the Â£150,000 threshold.</li></ul>" +
		"<p>Jeremy has said he would intervene to enforce laws on British overseas territories and dependencies if they do not comply with UK tax law, introduce anti-avoidance measures into UK law, and invest in HMRC so they can hire the staff needed to collect the tax the country badly needs.</p>"

    "id": "is-he-electable",
    "question": "... is he even electable?",
    "answer": 
        "Corbyn has attracted a massive numbers of new and very enthusiastic members.  With the right strategy, and hard work by us all, of course he is electable. That means persuading people of the case  for Corbyn as a different kind of leader and for the kind of society he wants to help build. He and his team are appealing to people who <span class=\"jcblack\"><strong>used to be cynical</strong></span> about politics or resigned to accepting whatever is dished out to them.  Their involvement and support will help too."

    "question": "... how could he get anything done with so many of PLP being against him?",
    "answer": 
        "If was elected as Prime Minister it is very likely there would be a realignment within the PLP. Having won an election his standing and authority would increase."

    "question": "...what about the NHS?",
    "answer":
        "A Corbyn led government would:<ul><li>End health service privatisation and bring services into a secure, publicly-provided NHS.</li><li>Integrate the NHS and social care for older and disabled people.</li><li>Ensure parity for mental health services.</li></ul>"

    "question": "... does he have any experience with foreign policy?",
    "answer":

        "Corbyn's supporters are from a wide variety of age groups and walks of life. After attending a meeting in Derby Paul Rogers (Bradford University) <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/paul-rogers/corbyn-crowd-and-its-signal\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> <i>\"I doubt that any other politician could have attracted such a crowd at the present time, nor for many years, at least in the English midlands. The mood was positive, appreciative but not 'over the top'. <strong>It was as far from a cult as you could imagine</strong>\". [emphasis added]. Why not <a href=\"http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/rallies\" target=\"_blank\">go to a rally?</a></i>"

    "id": "how-old-is-he-again",
    "question": "... he's too old!",
    "answer": "At 71, Jeremy Corbyn would be the oldest Prime Minister ever elected to a first term. He is now a fit and healthy 67 year old. Angela Eagle said of him during the EU Referendum that he was pursuing an agenda that would make a 25-year-old tired. He has demonstrated remarkable stamina during the current leadership campaign."
